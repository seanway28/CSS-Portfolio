        </div>
        <div class="right-side">
            <p><strong>Caterpillar</strong> For over a decade, Iâ€™ve leveraged my expertise in the generator industry
                        representing the <b>Caterpillar</b> and <b>General Electric</b> brand in various capacities. My
                        work experience as a generator project manager includes the development, management and
                        implementation of projects for <strong>Fortune 50 companies, major state organizations and large
                            metropolitan area municipalities.</strong>
                        Most recently, during my project management service with the Holt Caterpillar Power Systems
                        team, I managed a range of strategic generator projects through key CTQ project milestones,
                        including specifications, compliance, frequent scheduling updates, purchasing, manufacturing,
                        team oversight, delivery, installation, commissioning, service, budgeting and sales processes.
                        I have a strong project management orientation with proven ability to deliver plans and projects
                        on time, with superior organizational, time and task management skills. I have worked in union
                        environments for the majority of my career, and I am also accustomed to working all hours that
                        specific projects demand.
