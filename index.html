        <div class="right-side">
            <p>For over a decade, Iâ€™ve leveraged my expertise in the generator industry representing the <b>Caterpillar</b> and <b>General Electric</b> brand in various capacities. My work experience as a generator project manager includes the development, management and implementation of projects for <strong>Fortune 50 companies, major state organizations and large metropolitan area municipalities.</strong>
                Most recently, during my project management service with the Holt Caterpillar Power Systems team, I managed a range of strategic generator projects through key CTQ project milestones, including specifications, compliance, frequent scheduling updates, purchasing, manufacturing, team oversight, delivery, installation, commissioning, service, budgeting and sales processes.
                I have a strong project management orientation with proven ability to deliver plans and projects on time, with superior organizational, time and task management skills. I have worked in union environments for the majority of my career, and I am also accustomed to working all hours that specific projects demand.
